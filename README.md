# Todo-list-application

This application takes whatever you want to do and keep a list of it.

It isn't really a full todo list app as it only saves the todo in the period when the browser is awake, 
on reload the list will be clear 

Won't forget to thank Agata Krzywda whose https://medium.com/@aghh1504/1-simple-react-todo-list-52186b62976b medium post,
assisted me in building this my todo list application. 

Her's was just React build but it was a very big stepping ground into using Next.js as it works very well with React.

Would love to work more on it on Later days
